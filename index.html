<h2>What is Iraxes?</h2>
    <p>Iraxes is, in essence, a political quiz that attempts to assign percentages for 7 different political axes. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    <p>There are two versions of the quiz: a full version with 4 questions per axis, for a total of 56 questions, and a short version with 4 questions per axis, for a total of 28 questions. Feel free to take whichever.</p>
<h2>What are the 7 axes?</h2>
    <p>There are nine independent axes, where each has two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#fbc02d;">Offence vs. Defence</b><br/>
        Offence tends to favour hegemony at all costs, Defence tends to prefer appropriate amount of power.</p> 
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00796b;">Independence vs. Interdependence</b><br/>
        Independence tends to be content with military power, Interdependence tends to prefer considering the costs of using force.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#0288d1;">Irrationalism vs. Rationalism</b><br/>
        Irrationalism tends to favour momentary goals, Rationalism tends to prefer maximum utility.</p> 
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#689f38;">Securitization vs. Politization</b><br/>
        Securitization tends to favour moving questions out of the political arena, Politization tends to prefer perception of any question as a matter of politics.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#303f9f;">Statism vs. Individualism</b><br/>
        Statism tends to favour states as main political figures, Individualism tends to prefer people as a starting point</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#d32f2f;">Actors vs. Structures</b><br/>
        Actors tends to favour state as the only carriers of power, Structures tend to favour discources that make us act the way we act.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#f57c00;">Nationalism vs. Internationalism</b><br/>
        Nationalism tends to prefer independence in decision making, those with highter internationalism scores tend to prefer commonality in decision making up to world government</p>
